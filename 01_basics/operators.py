#trying different types of operators in python

a=10
b=3

#arithmetic operators
print("Add :",a," +",b," = ",a+b)
print("Sub :",a," -",b," = ",a-b)
print("Mul :",a," *",b," = ",a*b)
print("Div :",a," /",b," = ",a/b)
print("Modulo :",a," //",b," = ",a//b)

#comparision operators
print("is a equal to b? :", a==b)
print("is a not equal to b? :", a!=b)
print("is a greater to b? :", a>b)
print("is a lesser to b? :", a<b)

# logical Operators
x, y = True, False
print("x and y:", x and y)
print("x or y:", x or y)
print("not x:", not x)
